CMake for Audacity
==================

The purpose of this repo is to provide cmake build-system for audacity.

To avoid storing a copy of all audacity files this repo can be copied into audacity source dir.

What works:

- building audacity binary which runs and opens (tested with r12554).

Todo:

- ``install`` target.
- ``config.h`` headers.
- support 3rd party libs such as ffmpeg.
- translations.
